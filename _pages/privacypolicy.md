# Privacy Policy
Your data privacy is important to us. We have done our best to outline how your data is collected, stored and deleted, as easily as possible. We encourage you to read the entire document. The Moovin' iOS app maybe referred to as ‘Moovin'’, ‘iOS app’ or ‘app’ within this document.

**The Shortened version:** 
> We do **NOT** collect any data from you. No way to see what you're storing, no analytics of how you use the app. Your data is exactly that...yours.

<br>

## 1.0 Data Collection
What data is being collected by this app, and how it may present whilst using it.

### 1.1 Personal Information – Data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.
Whilst using the app, you maybe asked to provide your iTunes email address and password. This data is not collected by the app, and is instead used to verify your account with Apple. Skates has no access to this data, and it is not stored at anytime. Your information will not be used for any personalised marketing. For further about how Apple may use your personal information please visit the [Apple Privacy website](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

### 1.2 Non Personal Information – data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
The Moovin' app stores the Home Moves, Boxes, and items within Core Data. This is a Framework provided by Apple, and is secured by your Apple ID. We do not have access to any of the programs that you score. We do not log any keystrokes, search queries or how you use our app.

### 1.3 Analytics
This app uses no Third Party Analytics or metrics. The app does utilise Apple's Logging API, but this is stored on the device, and not sent to the developer. It is used when building the app in a development environment, and is not able to transmit logs remotely from other devices.


<br>

## 2.0 Third Party Libraries
The app does use some Third Party Libraries. However, none of these libraries are used to log any of your data. For transparency a list of the libraries can be found below, and within the About section of the app.

| Library | What is it used for? |
| :--- | :--- |
| MarkdownUI | Used to render Markdown text within the app. |

## 3.0 Updates to this Policy
We may change/amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review our Privacy Policy to stay informed.

Should we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide additional notice of those changes. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should remove the app.

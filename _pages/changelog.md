# Changelog
These are the moves that I have been making. From the first days of building, to moving-in day.


### `Beta`

# **0.9(4)**
Build 4 of version 0.9 fixes a few issues. They are listed below.
#### Bug Fixes
- iOS. Tapping close on the camera immediately after scanning a code would cause a crash.

# **0.9(3)**
Build 3 of version 0.9 fixes a few issues. They are listed below.
#### Bug Fixes
- macOS. Not having a home move, means that clicking the plus button wouldn't work. Now it will show a create your first move screen.
- iOS. Code Recognition improvements.
- WelcomeSheet for some reason would not dismiss. This has been fixed.

# **0.9**
Version 0.9 has been submitted for Beta testing on iOS and macOS. The iOS version was **approved** almost immediately, and the macOS version needing some fixes, which are detailed below.

#### Bug Fixes
- macOS sidebar size was hiding the 2 main buttons, increasing the minium width of the sidebar seems to have resolved this.

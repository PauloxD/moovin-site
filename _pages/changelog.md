# Changelog
This is the moves that we have been making. From the first days of the building, to moving in day.


### `Beta`

# **0.9**
Version 0.9 has been submitted for Beta testing on iOS and macOS. The iOS version was **approved** almost immediately, and the macOS version needing some fixes, which are detailed below.

#### Bug Fixes
- macOS sidebar size was hiding the 2 main buttons, increasing the minium width of the sidebar seems to have resolved this.

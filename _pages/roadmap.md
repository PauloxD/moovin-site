# Road map
What is in the pipeline for the Moovin' app. Here you'll find everything that I'm currently working on, or what I want to add to add to future releases of this app.


## In progress 
- Attachments to the item. Meaning you can take a picture of your possessions. 
- Protection Status of an item. Meaning you can redact an item unless authenticated


## Near future
- Siri Integration
- Widgets showing a pinned box, or number of boxes in each room.


## Hopeful wish list
- WatchOS companion
- Object detection for quick adding. When taking a picture of the item. The app would try to detect what the item is and auto fill the name.
